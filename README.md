# Portfolio

This is my professional portfolio site deployed on GitHub Pages! It is built in Javascript using React.js as well as vanilla, custom HTML and CSS. It features personal information about myself, my skills, some of my projects, and more!

The site can be accessed by visiting [https://declspecl.github.io](https://declspecl.github.io).

If you were to download and run this on your local machine, you would do that by cloning this repository with `git clone https://github.com/declspecl/declspecl.github.io`, running npm install, and running npm run start. Then, it will start a server on your localhost at port 3000 where you can see it!
